Once the turtle climbs to the surface of ground, which is the top of the well, it will not step down anymore. How many days will it take for turtle to escape from the well?

    "5. (Hard, Optional) Jason and Tony stand at two opposite ends of a 1000 meters long straight road. Suppose Jason is at the left end and Tony is at the right. At time 8:00, both Jason and Tony start to run towards the other end of the road but with different speed: 5 meters per second for Jason, and 3 meters per second for Tony. Once either of Jason or Tony reaches the end, he will turn back immediately and run towards the other end with the value of speed unchanged, and so on until to 8:10. It's obvious that Jason and Tony will meet each other several times at some points of time and place of the road.    \n",
